# Vercel Root Directory Solution - CRITICAL FIX

## 🚨 Problem Identified from Build Log

**Build Log Analysis:**
```
[13:49:07.370] Installing dependencies...
[13:49:21.121] added 184 packages in 14s  ← Dependencies installed in ROOT
[13:49:21.175] Detected Next.js version: 15.3.4  ← Next.js detected correctly
[13:49:21.396] > cd frontend-nextjs && npm run build  ← Build runs in subdirectory
[13:49:26.616] Error: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'  ← Dependencies not found!
```

**Root Cause:** Vercel installs dependencies in root directory but builds in subdirectory.

## 🎯 SOLUTION: Configure Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Vercel Project Settings
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click **Settings** tab
4. Navigate to **General** in sidebar

### Step 2: Configure Root Directory
1. Scroll to **Root Directory** section
2. **Current:** `.` (root directory)
3. **Change to:** `frontend-nextjs`
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Update Build Settings (Auto-detected)
After setting Root Directory, these will be auto-detected:
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (no need for cd command)
- **Output Directory:** `.next`
- **Install Command:** `npm install`
- **Framework:** Next.js

### Step 4: Trigger New Deployment
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on latest deployment
3. Select **Use existing Build Cache: No**
4. Click **Redeploy**

## ✅ Expected Results After Fix

**Build Process Will Change To:**
```
1. Vercel clones repository
2. Changes to frontend-nextjs/ directory (Root Directory setting)
3. Finds package.json with Next.js 15.3.4 ✅
4. Installs dependencies in frontend-nextjs/ ✅
5. Runs npm run build in frontend-nextjs/ ✅
6. All dependencies available during build ✅
```

**Build Log Should Show:**
```
Installing dependencies...
added 455 packages in 14s  ← More packages (includes UI deps)
Detected Next.js version: 15.3.4
Running "npm run build"  ← No cd command needed
Creating an optimized production build ✅
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Build Commands (if Root Directory fails)

If Root Directory setting doesn't work, use these manual commands:

**Build Command:**
```
cd frontend-nextjs && npm ci && npm run build
```

**Install Command:**
```
cd frontend-nextjs && npm ci
```

**Output Directory:**
```
frontend-nextjs/.next
```

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After applying the fix, verify:
- [ ] Root Directory set to `frontend-nextjs`
- [ ] Framework shows as "Next.js"
- [ ] Build command is `npm run build` (no cd)
- [ ] New deployment triggered
- [ ] Build log shows more packages installed
- [ ] No "Cannot find module" errors
- [ ] Deployment succeeds

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Dependencies installed: ~455 packages (not 184)
- ✅ No "cd frontend-nextjs" in build command
- ✅ No module resolution errors
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ App deploys and runs correctly
